# Combined Weather API

Weather.me is a modular, personalizable weather application designed to empower users by giving them full control over their weather dashboard. It allows users to choose what information they want to see and organize it in a way that best suits their needs.  

The application is built with **React** and styled using the **Material UI** library, offering a sleek, seamless design that enhances the user experience. The front end is supported by the **CombinedWeatherAPI** on the back end, which handles the heavy lifting by efficiently retrieving and processing weather data, delivering it to users in a clear and user-friendly format.  

**Combined Weather API** combines the information gathered from several other APIs to output relevant information for the front end. It also accesses and stores country, state and city data into a local database that it self-populates and self-manages.
